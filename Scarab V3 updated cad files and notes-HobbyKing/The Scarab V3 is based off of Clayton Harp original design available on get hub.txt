The Scarab V3 is based off of Clayton Harp original design available on get hub 
https://github.com/gearwolf-OP/Scarab-V3
It has had a few changes to make it more compatible with a range of hardware and to make it lighter.
• The frame stacks have had the lightening holes adjusted for better strength and weight savings
• The arms have been redesigned to accept most motor options and an Aluminum optimized design for greater strength and lighter over the G10 version
